- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ZacharyFredeman

About ME: 
  Continuously looking to learn and improve my skills.
  At Marist College I began pursuing a degree in Computer Science to follow my passion and interest in technology. While there I gained knowledge in a wide variety of different disciplines in computer Science ranging from IT work, Software Development and Database Management to, Front End, Back End,  UI UX Design, and Website Development. I've always possessed a strong passion for game design. While pursuing my Degree in Computer Science at Marist, I choose a focus in game design to gain experience in the development process of games. I went on further to achieve a minor in games and emerging media. To gain more experience I have participated in several Game jams, as well as learning Unity and UnReal Engine 5 on my own in my spare time.

Projects Ive Worked On: 
 Capping Project- Capping team Community -https://github.com/CappingTeam-Community/Forum 
  A community consists of a group of people that share the same interest. It could be a hobby, a talent, or a game that people enjoy playing. 
  Much like a real community, â€˜Communityâ€™ is a forum-based, web application that allows users to find and create posts specific to a particular topic. 
  People with the same interests and backgrounds can peruse various discussion threads, leave comments, share other media, and upvote other usersâ€™ posts. 
  Users also have the opportunity to create an account, which keeps track of their topic preferences and activity on the platform. 
  Community has an easy-to-use UI and intuitive layout to ensure users can focus on the topics they are passionate for. 
  
  GameJams: 
    Little Trouble:
      Explore the world you know from a different perspective -- how would a bug-sized person utilize their surroundings? Find items and maneuver around this little world in search of a new friend and a new home.
      For Github's GameOff 2021 on itch.io, I worked in a 2 person team to develope a 2d platformer game within a one month time frame. The theme for the Game Jam was "Bug". The idea for our game was to play as a bug sized person that is looking for a new home which was inspired by the movie "The Secret World of Arrietty". The game was made using Unity and devloped completly from scratch, that includes all art, code and world design. My primary task was the development of the scripts, and design and mapping of the world. 
      The development process of the game did come with its troubles. Both me and my partner were full time college students, leaving us to juggle school as well as finding time to work on the project. This was also one of the first game jams we both particpated in which left a lot for us to learn on the fly. THe Process of the game jam taught me alot and the end result was a project in which I am proud of the result.

    ET: 
      A recreate with a twist of the original E.T. game made for the atari for Marist Game Jam 2021. Given 48 hours to develop a complete game with the theme of the Game Jam being "A Classic Reimagined". The team of 6 I worked in decide to reimagine the classic E.T for the atari which was almost brought down the game industry. For our idea we decide it was time for E.T to fight back against the goverment. The game starts with you playing the original E.T for the atari, but this time you arent collecting parts of a phone. After collecting 3 parts to create a shotgun the game turns into a 2d shooter, where you must escape from the goverment.
      This was the first game jam I ever worked on. I was in charge of creating the player script for the 2d shooter. The game jam acted as a great learning experience, and I learned many key aspects og game development.
