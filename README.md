About ME: 
  Continuously looking to learn and improve my skills.
    At Marist College I began pursuing a degree in Computer Science to follow my passion and interest in technology. While there I gained knowledge in a wide variety of different disciplines in computer Science ranging from IT work, Backend software development and database management to, front end UI creation and website design. 
  I've always possessed a strong passion for game design. While pursuing my Degree in Computer Science at Marist, I choose a focus in game design to gain experience in the development process of games. I went on further to achieve a minor in games and emerging media. To gain more experience I have participated in several Game jams, as well as learning Unity and unReal Engine 5 on my own in my spare time.

Projects Ive Worked On: 
 Capping Project- Capping team Community -https://github.com/CappingTeam-Community/Forum 
  A community consists of a group of people that share the same interest. It could be a hobby, a talent, or a game that people enjoy playing. 
  Much like a real community, ‘Community’ is a forum-based, web application that allows users to find and create posts specific to a particular topic. 
  People with the same interests and backgrounds can peruse various discussion threads, leave comments, share other media, and upvote other users’ posts. 
  Users also have the opportunity to create an account, which keeps track of their topic preferences and activity on the platform. 
  Community has an easy-to-use UI and intuitive layout to ensure users can focus on the topics they are passionate for.
