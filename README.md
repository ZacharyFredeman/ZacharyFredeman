- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ZacharyFredeman

About ME: 
  Continuously looking to learn and improve my skills.
    At Marist College I began pursuing a degree in Computer Science to follow my passion and interest in technology. While there I gained knowledge in a wide variety of different disciplines in computer Science ranging from IT work, Backend software development and database management to, front end UI creation and website design. 
  I've always possessed a strong passion for game design. While pursuing my Degree in Computer Science at Marist, I choose a focus in game design to gain experience in the development process of games. I went on further to achieve a minor in games and emerging media. To gain more experience I have participated in several Game jams, as well as learning Unity and unReal Engine 5 on my own in my spare time.

  Robotics, AI, Machine Learning, Game Develoment, Frontend Development, Frisbee
  

Projects Ive Worked On: 
 Capping Project- Capping team Community -https://github.com/CappingTeam-Community/Forum 
  A community consists of a group of people that share the same interest. It could be a hobby, a talent, or a game that people enjoy playing. 
  Much like a real community, â€˜Communityâ€™ is a forum-based, web application that allows users to find and create posts specific to a particular topic. 
  People with the same interests and backgrounds can peruse various discussion threads, leave comments, share other media, and upvote other usersâ€™ posts. 
  Users also have the opportunity to create an account, which keeps track of their topic preferences and activity on the platform. 
  Community has an easy-to-use UI and intuitive layout to ensure users can focus on the topics they are passionate for.
